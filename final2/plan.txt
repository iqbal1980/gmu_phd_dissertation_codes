1. Decide on Your “Minimum Viable” Model Scope
Focus on One or Two Key Cell Types

You mentioned single‐cell pericyte + possible endothelial cell (EC). If time is short, decide which cell’s behavior is most essential to show a new scientific contribution. Possibly start with pericytes alone if that’s your main experiment.
If you add endothelial cells, keep the model minimal: Kir + a background current, ± TRPV4 if relevant. Resist feature creep (like adding too many channels that scRNA‐seq shows are negligible).
Settle on the PDE or PDE‐like Approach

You already have a PDE‐like approach in multicell_rhs(...) for the 23‐state model. That’s sufficiently advanced. Don’t rewrite from scratch again. Instead, refine it with the new parameters or new channels from scRNA data.
Limit the Number of Parameter Sweeps

You have a huge param space in the GA/DEAP code and Bayesian codes. This is good for thoroughness, but can be endless. If your committee is pushing for “biological realism,” it’s okay to fix some param ranges using scRNA expression + patch data.
In other words, shrink your parameter space to the “confidence intervals” suggested by experiment. That alone can drastically reduce simulation time.
2. Make the Single‐Cell Model Rock‐Solid First
Implement scRNA‐Seq–Driven Channel Inventory

As we discussed earlier, match transcripts to functional channels. If Kir2.1 is high, put a big Kir Gmax. If Piezo1 is moderate, maybe you add a small mechanosensitive leak. If Ca_V is basically nonexistent in pericytes, you cut it.
That single‐cell model is the foundation. You can show you tested/validated it with relevant voltage‐clamp or Ca²⁺ clamp data from your references or from your lab’s patch data.
Validate

If possible, replicate a known “classic” figure in the literature (like a Kir current–voltage curve at multiple [K+]o, or a typical pericyte Ca²⁺ transient).
Even a quick “the model’s resting potential is −40 mV, which matches the average from real pericytes” can be huge for your Methods/Results chapter.
Profile & Speed Up

If your single‐cell code is slow in Python, profile it and see if using numba or cython or pytorch jitting or even C++ can give a 10× speed‐up. Minimizing the per‐simulation cost will make the multi‐cell PDE approach less painful.
3. Then “Scale Up” to a Multi‐Cell or 1D PDE Model
Re‐Use the 23‐State PDE or the PDE‐like Gap‐Junction Approach

From your posted code (multicell_rhs, run_multicell_sim), adapt your final, polished single‐cell function, and just place it inside that PDE structure.
Decide how many cells you really need for a 1D chain or “sheet.” If the committee just wants proof of conduction or wave propagation, maybe 5–10 cells is enough. Then show “ scaling to 100 cells is possible.”
Add Variation

You can do a small randomization of Kir or leak conductances across cells (based on scRNA variability). Show how conduction changes. That’s a real contribution: “We tested conduction in a realistic heterogenous chain of pericytes.”
Validate

If you have references or prior experiments with conduction velocity or wave front speed, compare your PDE results with that. Even a rough “the conduction velocity is ∼1 mm/s, which is consistent with [Ref].”
4. If Time Allows: 2D / 3D Extensions or PINNs
Be Realistic

Full 3D microvasculature with pericytes + endothelium + RBC flow is ambitious. If your committee wants it, do a coarse, simplified version (maybe 2D with ∼50 cells) just as a proof of concept.
Or you can rely on simpler 1D PDE conduction to illustrate your main thesis that K⁺ or Ca²⁺ signals can propagate from pericytes to neighboring cells.
Physics‐Informed Neural Nets (PINNs)?

If your PDE is very large or if you want to do parameter inference, PINNs can be interesting. But be sure you have a clear use‐case (like partial observation from experiments, or boundary condition optimization). If it’s not yielding a clear advantage, it’s better to finalize the PDE model with standard ODE/PDE solvers.
5. Parameter Fitting Strategy—Keep It “Targeted”
Use Biological Constraints

Instead of letting a GA or Bayesian method roam huge param bounds (like 0.1–35 for g_gap), narrow it to 0.02–0.2 or something that is physically plausible from prior conduction studies.
The code you posted uses a big fitness function: (coefficients[0] - 2)^2 + (coefficients[1] - 3.2)^2. That might be a big guess. If you have data from “cohort 1” or “paper X” that says the slope of conduction is ∼1.8–2.2, that’s how you refine your objective function to be less guessy.
Parallelize

If you have HPC or cluster access, spin up multiple param sets in parallel. These PDE codes can be slow, so parallelization is key.
Also, store all results in a single CSV or HDF5 file so you can systematically analyze them afterward. Don’t let them get scattered across “At399.txt,” “At99.txt,” etc.
6. Write Up & “Close the Loop” with Experiments
Document each piece

For your Methods chapter, present the final “Single‐Cell Model Equations” with (1) ODE system, (2) channel gating equations, (3) parameter table referencing your scRNA or patch data.
Then the PDE or multi‐cell approach: “We repeated for N cells, with gap‐junction coupling current I_gj = g_gap*(...). We used solve_ivp, time step=..., etc.”
Highlight “New Insight”

Make sure you emphasize what’s novel: maybe you show that “with scRNA‐seq–based Kir distribution, conduction is robust up to X distance, but fails if Kir is below Y threshold.” That is a publishable insight.
If the committee asks “Is the code validated?”

Show them at least one or two direct comparisons to real experimental data or a known phenomenon from the literature (like biphasic Ca²⁺ wave in pericytes, or conduction velocity matching an earlier paper). That’s often enough to demonstrate you have a robust model.
Final Thoughts
Trim your code to a single, well‐structured Python project (or two at most) rather than many partial scripts.
Automate your parameter sweeps in a consistent, HPC‐friendly manner.
Aim for “a story”: single‐cell → small PDE chain → partial parameter inference → compare with experiment → done.
By focusing on those steps, you’ll have a biologically meaningful, computationally tractable model that stands up in a PhD defense. You don’t need perfect realism for every channel—just enough to demonstrate the key pericyte or conduction phenomena, with credible parameter estimates and references to real data. Then you can declare victory and submit that thesis. Good luck!
